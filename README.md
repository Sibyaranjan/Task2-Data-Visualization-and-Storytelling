# Task2-Data-Visualization-and-Storytelling
The task-2 showcases an interactive Power BI dashboard developed with the Superstore dataset. The main aim was to evaluate sales, profit, and order quantities at different levels like segments, categories, shipping methods, regions, and states. The dashboard offers actionable insights that can improve business leaders' decision-making, enhance profitability, and customer experience.

Key Steps Performed:-

1. Data Preparation & Cleaning

(i) Worked with raw Superstore data to make it consistent and accurate.

(ii) Managed missing values and arranged the dataset for analysis. 

(iii) Developed calculated fields and DAX measures (e.g., Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Quantity).

2. Dashboard Creation in Power BI

(i) Designed top-level KPIs:

Total Sales → 2M

Total Quantity → 38K

Total Profit → 286K

(ii) Developed interactive filters (Region-wise analysis: Central, East, South, West).

(iii) Created several visuals to encompass various aspects of the business:

Sales by Segment – Contribution of Corporate, Consumer, and Home Office.

Sales & Profit Trends – Monthly and yearly performance monitoring.

Category & Sub-Category Sales – Comparison of performance across product categories.

Sales by Ship Mode – Customer shipping method preference and revenue contribution.

Sales & Profit by State – Geographic visualization of performance with a map.
